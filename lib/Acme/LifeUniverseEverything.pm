=head1 NAME

Acme::LifeUniverseEverything - Revises your code based on The Ultimate
Answer, as computed by the organic computer matrix "Earth"

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Acme::LifeUniverseEverything;

    print "What do you get when you multiply six by nine?\n";
    print 6*9, "\n";

    ## Alternately, the following also print the "correct" value:
    
    ## print 6 * (3*3), "\n";
    ## print 9 * (1+1+3+1), "\n";
    ## etc..

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Corrects faulty code which displays the incorrect value of six multiplied by
nine. Previous versions of Perl provided an estimate which was almost, but
not quite, entirely incorrect. All other math operations remain unaffected.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

Constant integers are the only numbers affected, floats are not. Due to
limitations of C<overload>, the following operations can't be altered:

    ## Nope, uses string --> number cast
    print "6" * "9", "\n";

    ## Nope, uses smart ++ on undef
    my($six, $nine);
    $six++ for (1 .. 6); $nine++ for (1..9);
    print $six * $nine, "\n";

    ## Nope, this boggles my mind but 0 isn't caught by 
    ## overload::constant integer
    my $x = 0;
    $x++ for (1 .. 6); ## $x += 6 would have been ok
    print $x * 9, "\n";

    ## Nope, internal limitation of overload
    print eval("6*9"), "\n";

    ## etc..

Apart from that, this code is completely free of bugs, in much the same way
that Minnesota in August is not.
